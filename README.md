# NASA_Meteorite_Landings_Visualization

This repository contains a set of data visualizations that I created based on a NASA meteorite landings dataset.

From it, the following visualizations were created using Python for the sake of exploratory data analysis:

* Plot 1 - Multi-Faceted Bar Plot
* Plot 2 - Multi-Faceted Count Plot
* Plot 3 - Heatmap
* Plot 4 - Boxplot
* Plot 5 - Proportion Plot - Pie Plot
* Plot 6 - Scatter Plot
* Plot 7 - Line Plot

Each of the visualizations listed above along with a brief explanation of the insights derived from them can be found in the IPython Notebook called Meteorite_Landings_Data_Visualization_Project.ipynb

Table of Contents:

1) Meteorite_Landings_Data_Visualization_Project.ipynb - IPython Notebook showcasing the Python code used to create the visualizations listed above along with the successfully run outputs.
2) Meteorite_Landings_Dataset.csv - CSV file used to create the visualizations listed above. Feel free to download this if you seek to recreate this project or have an interest in performing your own analysis based on it.
